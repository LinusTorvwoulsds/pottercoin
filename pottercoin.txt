Pottercoin (POTB) mining calculation plan to reduce production:
Pottercoin's original parent currency circulation totaled 27 million 
pieces, with a total of 663 million mineral pools; the parent currency is 
a mining machine; it can be permanently mined, and the mines are all 
excavated for the fastest 37 years.
Pottercoin's mining power reduction uses a new generation of smart 
contract mining machines similar to Bitcoin's mining power reduction, 
with the advantages of no electricity and no mining loss.
Pottercoin's mining power is based on the mining capacity of the 
highest mining machine. The mining power is reduced by half every 
two years. The maximum total output can be excavated in the first 10 
years of 27 million pieces. After 10 years, it can be dug every 2 years. 
The maximum total output is 27 million, so the calculation output of 
the mining machine will be halved or reduced when the mining power 
is close to the peak (27 million computing power). For example, in the 
first two years, the highest per million vouchers can be excavated 
49.8, the second two years, the highest per 10,000 master coin 
mining machine can dig 24.9, the third two years, the highest per 
10,000 mothers The mining machine can dig up 12.45, and so on, 
halving every 2 years; until all the blocks TOKEN are dug out. When 
the mine calculation power of a node mining machine reaches the 
super mine calculation power, a 20,000 POTB mining machine can be 
permanently obtained, and the mine dividend is permanently enjoyed.
